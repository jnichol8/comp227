This course is an introduction to modern web development with JavaScript.\nThe main focus is on single-page applications implemented with React and supporting them with RESTful web services implemented with Node.js.\nThe course also has parts on TypeScript, Redux, and React Native.</p>\n<p>Other topics include debugging applications, container technology, configuration, managing runtime environments, and databases.</p>\n<h3>Course material</h3>\n<p>The course material is meant to be read one part at a time and in order.</p>\n<p>The material contains exercises, which are placed so that the preceding material provides enough information for solving each exercise.\nYou can do the exercises as you encounter them in the material,\nbut it can also be beneficial to read all of the material in the part before starting with the exercises.</p>\n<p>In many parts of the course, the exercises build one larger application one small piece at a time.\nSome of the exercise applications are developed through multiple parts.</p>\n<p>The course material is based on incrementally expanding example applications, which change from part to part.\nIt's best to follow the code along while making small modifications independently.\nThe code of the example applications for each step of each part can be found on GitHub.</p>\n<h3>Taking the course</h3>\n<p>The course contains 10 parts, the first of which is numbered 0 for consistency with past iterations.\nOne part corresponds loosely to around two weeks of studying, since you'll have other activities attached as well.\nThis has been taken into account with respect to coursework.</p>\n<p>For parts 0-5, You should not study part <em>n+1</em> without enough know-how of the topics in part <em>n</em>.\nIn pedagogic terms, the course uses <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastery_learning\">Mastery Learning</a>.</p>\n<p>In parts 0-4 you are expected to do <em>at least</em> all of the exercises that are not marked with an asterisk(*).\nYou should only proceed to the next part after doing enough of the previous part's exercises.\n<strong><em>Once you mark or open up the next section of exercises, we will not grade any additional exercises from the previous part.</em></strong>\nExercises marked with an asterisk count towards your final grade, but skipping them does not prevent you from doing the compulsory exercises in the next parts.\nOther parts do not have asterisk-marked exercises since there is no similar dependency on previous parts.</p>\n<h3>Studying the course in a nutshell</h3>\n<p>How to study the course â€“ instructions in a nutshell:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do the exercises. The exercises are submitted through GitHub and marking them as done on Canvas.</li>\n<li>You need to work regularly.\nThe easiest way to fall behind in the course is to not work on it every couple of days.\nSet yourself an alarm...do anything! But make it a habit of working on it at least 3 times a week for a little bit of time.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Submitting exercises</h3>\n<p>You will be submitting exercises via the GitHub classroom repos that will be provided on Canvas.\n<strong>All of the exercises from this website must be submitted through GitHub.</strong>\nYou will also be expected to submit your progress for exercises regularly, even if it is not finished.</p>\n<p>Exercises are submitted <strong>one part at a time</strong>.\nOnce you have submitted exercises for a part, you can no longer submit any more exercises for that part.</p>\n<p>A system for detecting plagiarism is used to check exercises submitted to GitHub.\nIf code is found from model answers or multiple students hand in the same code,\nthe situation is handled according to the policy on plagiarism as outlined in the syllabus.</p>\n<p>Many of the exercises build a larger application bit by bit.\nYou will be expected to commit often so that you show your work as you move through the course.\nYou will need to practice committing early and often.\nIt is the equivalent of showing your work in class.</p>\n<h3>Full stack project</h3>\n<p>For the project, an application is implemented in React and/or Node, though implementing a mobile application in React Native is also possible.</p>\n<p>Most of you will be working in pairs or in groups on the final project.</p>\n<p>More information about the project will be released via Canvas</p>\n<h3>Before you start</h3>\n<p>Using a Chromium-based browser like <a href=\"https://www.google.com/chrome/\">Chrome</a> is recommended while developing because\nit provides great tools for web development.\nI will be showing you and providing screenshots of those tools.\nAnother alternative is the <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/\">Developer Edition of Firefox</a>,\nwhich provides a similar range of features.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"/part0/configuring_your_machine_for_this_course\">part 0d</a> we'll provide detailed instructions for installing some of the tools that we will be using extensively:\n<a href=\"https://git-scm.org\">Git</a> (via GitHub),\n<a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/\">Webstorm</a>\nand <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/\">Node.js</a>.</p>\n<p>The course exercises will be submitted to GitHub, so Git must be installed and you should know how to use it.</p>\n<h3>Typos in the material</h3>\n<p>If you find a typo in the material, or something has been expressed unclearly or is simply bad grammar,\nsubmit a <em>pull request</em> to the course material in the <a href=\"https://github.com/comp227/comp227\">repository</a>.\nFor example, the markdown source code of this page can be found in the repository at <a href=\"https://github.com/comp227/comp227/edit/source/src/content/0/en/part0a.md\">https://github.com/comp227/comp227/edit/source/src/content/0/en/part0a.md</a></p>\n<p>At the bottom of each part of the material is a link to <strong>propose changes to the material</strong>.\nYou can edit the source code of the page by clicking on the link.</p>\n<p>There are also lots of links in the material for many kinds of background material.\nIf you notice that a link is broken (that happens too often...),\npropose a change or ping us in Discord if you do not find a replacement for the broken link.</p>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"mainImage":{"publicURL":"/static/b9999ec785b2c3bc6b8d3ef5d3537538/part-0.svg"},"part":0,"letter":"b","lang":"en"}}},"pageContext":{"part":0,"letter":"b","lang":"en"}}}
