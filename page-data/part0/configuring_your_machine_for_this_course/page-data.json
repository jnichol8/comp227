To check, I would type in Terminal:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">git</span> config --list</code></pre></div>\n<p>If by doing that you get a list of options, two of them being your correct <code class=\"language-text\">user.name</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">user.email</code> (that you have in GitHub),\nIf you do see the options, I'd also like you to verify that you have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>git bash</em> - (a command-line/terminal program) that comes with the git package we'll install</li>\n<li>a package manager - (something like <em>winget</em>, <em>choco</em>, <em>scoop</em> or <em>brew</em>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have all of that then you can <a href=\"#4-install-node\">move on to step 4</a>.</p>\n<p>If this is all foreign to you, then please read on.</p>\n<h4>Using a package manager</h4>\n<p>If you saw something like: <em>command not found</em>, we'll need to install <strong><a href=\"https://git-scm.com/downloads\">git</a></strong>, which we'll be using to manage our projects.\n<strong><em>We will install git using a package manager.</em></strong>\nA <strong>package manager</strong> is a piece of software that keeps track of what you've installed and allows you to easily install and uninstall entire programs.\nMany can (when you ask them to) also upgrade to new versions when those become available.<br>\nJust make sure your terminal program is open and type (or copy)</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Windows</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Mac</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code class=\"language-text\">winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><code class=\"language-text\">brew install git</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Press enter and wait.  It's not too bad.  If it complains, you may need administrative privileges, but just let it do its work.</p>\n<p>Once it finishes, you may need to restart your terminal, but then we'll get to this</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong><em>Please leave your terminal of choice open as we'll be using it shortly again to install other applications.</em></strong></p>\n<p>Successfully installing git via the package manager means that you can skip to the <a href=\"#3-configure-git\">next section and move to configure git</a>.</p>\n<h3>2 Alternative: Traditional git directions</h3>\n<p>You should <em>really</em> learn <a href=\"#2-making-sure-git-is-installed\">to use a package manager</a>!\nHowever, if that makes you queasy or you are running into major issues, here's how to install git the regular way.\nGo to <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/downloads\">https://git-scm.com/downloads</a> (or search “download git” via\ngoogle) Pick your operating system of choice.\nIf you are on a lab\ncomputer, you may need to select the portable version once you get to\nthe windows page.</p>\n<picture><img src=\"/static/d591c82c574e353f60dc51e4a9874094/5a190/gitportable.png\" alt=\"git-scm

800px\"></picture>\n<h4>Get Git Installed</h4>\n<p>After downloading the installer open it up and install it on your\ncomputer.\nAll of the default options should be fine in this situation,\nthough you can change some options if you feel necessary.\nMake sure\nthough that the <strong>option to commit in Unix Line Endings is enabled</strong>.\nKeep that preference.\nThat will help sure that your files will play nice\nwith everyone else.\nOnce you have it installed, go ahead and open it,\nand let’s change some user preferences in git.</p>\n<h3>3: Configure Git</h3>\n<p>To streamline your git activity, let’s add some of your credentials to\ngit preferences.\nI took most of this from the <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2\">git-scm book</a>, but you’ll\nwant to <strong>set the git preferences on all the computers that you use.</strong>  Let me say that again in big letters</p>\n<h4>Set your git preferences on all computers that you will work on</h4>\n<p>In addition to installing git, we need to make sure that we outline or configure our setup so that git knows who you are.\nWith your terminal open, setup the git user email id and username by typing these commands,\nmaking sure to replace the sections with your actual email and username</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">git</span> config --global user.email your_github_email@u.pacific.edu\n<span class=\"token function\">git</span> config --global user.name your_github_username</code></pre></div>\n<p>Make sure you press enter after each command.</p>\n<p>Vim is the default text editor that is used in the command line.\nIf you aren’t comfortable or have never used vim, you can set up other Unix text\neditors instead.\nSo if you'd like to use emacs you’d write:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">git</span> config --global core.editor emacs</code></pre></div>\n<p>If you’re like me, you’ll want to use something like <a href=\"https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/\">notepad++</a> or\npossibly some other text editor that you love.\nIn those cases, you’d have to provide the entire path.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">git</span> config --global core.editor <span class=\"token string\">\"'C:/Program Files/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -nosession\"</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Now to check your preferences, enter the command</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">git</span> config --list</code></pre></div>\n<p>You should now see your username and email displayed among lots of other options.</p>\n<h3>4: Install Node</h3>\n<p>Now with our handy package manager, we need to install <strong><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/\">node.js</a></strong> AKA <strong>node</strong>.\nIf you already have node installed,\nmake sure it is at least version 16.13.2.\nWe will discuss node.js further in <a href=\"../../1/en/part1.md\">part 1</a>.</p>\n<p>For this class, I'm going to install nvm first so that we can use a specific version of node,\nsince the bulk of this course was written and tested with Node 16.13.2.\nIf that is the case, you could also install <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm\">NVM</a></strong>,\nwhich allows us to have different versions of node.js on our computer and switch between them.</p>\n<p>This can be done via one of these commands.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Windows</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Mac</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code class=\"language-text\">winget install -e CoreyButler.NVMforWindows</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><code class=\"language-text\">brew install nvm</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>After installing nvm, you can use the nvm's help to install a version (like 16.3.2, which is what I'll do).\nType nvm to navigate through, and you'll notice that you need to these two commands separately.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">nvm <span class=\"token function\">install</span> <span class=\"token number\">16.3</span>\nnvm use <span class=\"token number\">16</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>After this, you should be able to type <code class=\"language-text\">node -v</code> and you'll notice that it should print out <code class=\"language-text\">v16.3.0</code>.</p>\n<p>To prepare you to use webstorm we'll follow a couple more commands here:</p>\n<p>One is to type the following lines, which creates a <strong><em>symbolic link</em></strong> where WebStorm can find the version of node we are using.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token builtin class-name\">export</span> <span class=\"token assign-left variable\">NVM_SYMLINK_CURRENT</span><span class=\"token operator\">=</span>true\nnvm use default</code></pre></div>\n<h4>4 Alternate: Installing node directly</h4>\n<p>Alternatively, you can try to just install node without using a version manager.\nI've taken the <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/\">installation instructions</a> for node and provided the most popular options here.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Windows</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Mac</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code class=\"language-text\">winget install -e OpenJS.NodeJS</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><code class=\"language-text\">brew install node</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><em>You should only use this option if you have trouble doing anything with nvm.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Regardless of which option you choose,\nNode package manager <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm\">npm</a> will be automatically installed with Node.js.\nWe will be actively using npm throughout the course.\nNode also comes with <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx\">npx</a>,\nwhich we'll need a few times.</p>\n<h3>5: Join our GitHub Classroom</h3>\n<p>At

from JetBrains.\nYou can do this with the package manager by merely typing <code class=\"language-text\">winget install JetBrains.WebStorm</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">brew install --cask webstorm</code> in your Terminal depending on your configuration.\nWhile I am OK if you decide to use <a href=\"http://code.visualstudio.com\">VS Code</a> instead,\nplease be aware that I will only be supporting or answering questions about Webstorm.\n<em>Some of the pictures below may be from PHPStorm, which is just like WebStorm, except it's designed for PHP.\nIf you see pictures below that have PHPStorm, pretend they say Webstorm, they behave similarly.</em>\nThis also goes for anything that mentions COMP 127 (Assume it's 227).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/\">WebStorm</a> is a web development editor from JetBrains\n(<em>Make sure that you activate an <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students\">educational license</a> from them</em>).</p>\n<p>If you haven't already, use the command line to download WebStorm.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Windows</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Mac</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code class=\"language-text\">winget install -e JetBrains.WebStorm</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><code class=\"language-text\">brew install --cask webstorm</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>As you are downloading the product, make sure that you fill out the <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students\">student application</a>.\nWhile WebStorm offers a 30-day free trial, we want to start the application process early to avoid any hiccups.\nJetbrains provides free access to all Jetbrains products while you're a student.</p>\n<p>Once it finishes installing and you pass all the permissions, you can open it up.</p>\n<p>You'll be greeted with a simple window.</p>\n<picture><img src=\"/static/2ca0abb62e6036572176b196beaaa67e/52dba/import_settings.png\" alt=\"import settings\"

374px\"></picture>\n<p>Most of you will choose not to import settings and click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>\n<p>At this point, you'll now move on to the project page, where you'll need a project.\n<strong>Leave Webstorm open for now.</strong></p>\n<picture><img src=\"/static/65557fb75af9d05bb5f3fbcbf3a51c9c/4971b/webstorm_first_time.png\" alt=\"Select VCS from the opening page\"

repository from the GitHub classroom assignment.</p>\n<p>Now that we have WebStorm and a GitHub repo, we are almost ready to connect WebStorm to our GitHub profile and to the repo we created via GitHub classroom.</p>\n<p>Before we can do that though, we need to generate credentials that the computer can use to login to GitHub via Webstorm.\nLet's do that now.  </p>\n<h3>7: Generate a GitHub token</h3>\n<p>In the past two years, with even more threats to security,\nGitHub has moved to have us use tokens to access our projects from our computers.\n<strong>Tokens</strong> act like credentials but have much more fine-grained controls on what they can and cannot access.\nTokens are slightly analogous to using a temporary credit card number for purchases,\ninstead of giving everyone access to your bank account.\nBecause Webstorm will be constantly communicating with GitHub, let's generate a token that will be stored on our computer.</p>\n<p>Go back to <a href=\"http://github.com\">GitHub</a> and log in,\nthen click on your profile icon in the upper right,\nand then go to <a href=\"https://imgur.com/S1E0tQc\"><em>Settings->Developer settings->Personal Access Tokens->Tokens (classic)->Generate new token->Generate new token (classic)</em></a>.\nThen give the token a name,\nset expiration to <em>Custom</em> (providing a date up to 1 year from now) and select the <code class=\"language-text\">repo, workflow, read:org and gist</code> checkboxes for the scopes.\nOnce you do that, scroll to the bottom and click the green Generate new Token.\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/LUAt5DU\">I did another short animation of this as well.</a>\nYou'll then see a page that has the token that says to copy it because you won't be able to see it again.</p>\n<picture><img src=\"/static/a5821fd3e0d57157d6a4ee919265a784/5a190/github_token_ready.png\" alt=\"token about to expire\" srcset=\"/static/a5821fd3e0d57157d6a4ee919265a784/772e8/github_token_ready.png 200w,\n/static/a5821fd3e0d57157d6a4ee919265a784/e17e5/github_token_ready.png 400w,\n/static/a5821fd3e0d57157d6a4ee919265a784/5a190/github_token_ready.png 800w,\n/static/a5821fd3e0d57157d6a4ee919265a784/eb2af/github_token_ready.png 954w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"></picture>\n<p>Make sure to copy it someplace safe or leave the page open for now.\nIf you do lose the token, you can safely generate a new one.\nYou may also want to consider deleting the old one, which prevents it from being used anymore.</p>\n<h3>8: Connect Webstorm with GitHub</h3>\n<p>Now what we will do is:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Take the GitHub repo that we generated from GitHub classroom</li>\n<li>Copy the link for it</li>\n<li>Switch to WebStorm and select <strong><em>Get From VCS</em></strong>, using the copied URL from GitHub.</li>\n<li>After clicking OK, select <strong><em>Use Token</em></strong> from the authentication options</li>\n<li>Switch back to the token page that we just generated and copy that token</li>\n<li>Paste that token back into WebStorm</li>\n<li>Trust and open the project.  </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Following all of these steps would result in the project opening up, with it opening up the <em>README.md</em> file.</p>\n<p>Here's a recap in a <a href=\"https://imgur.com/UDQXB6V\">re-looping gif of all of these steps that you should see</a></p>\n<h4>Other permissions</h4>\n<p>The other permission you may have to set is to allow JetBrains access to comp227's organizational space.\nYou can do this by <a href=\"https://github.com/settings/applications#authorized\">visiting GitHub's apps settings</a> and then clicking on <strong>JetBrains IDE Integration</strong>.\nClick on that and then you should be able to see the heading <strong><em>Organization Access</em></strong>.\nClick on the <strong><em>Grant</em></strong> button next to comp227, and now try cloning the project again.</p>\n<h4>Configure your settings</h4>\n<p>When you have a new dev environment, it often is beneficial to spend a little bit of time tweaking things to your liking\n(but not too much initially, spend no more than 10-15 minutes).</p>\n<p>I'll go over a few different settings that I've found useful:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#changing-keyboard-shortcuts\">Changing your keyboard shortcuts</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#changing-our-default-terminal-app\">Changing your default terminal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#enabling-autosave\">Enabling autosave</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Changing keyboard shortcuts</h4>\n<p>Since by this point I have become accustomed to eclipse keyboard shortcuts, WebStorm provides an ability in its settings to use an Eclipse keymap.\nThey also have other keymaps as well.\nFor me this allows me to not have to worry about learning new keyboard shortcuts,\nI can continue using handy shortcuts from eclipse like:\n(<strong><em>Alt-Up/Down</em></strong>, <strong><em>Ctrl-D</em></strong>, <strong><em>Alt-Shift-R</em></strong>, <strong><em>Ctrl-Shift-Up</em></strong>, <strong><em>Alt-Shift-M</em></strong>, or <strong><em>Alt-Shift-H</em></strong>, to name a few).</p>\n<p>To switch your keyboard shortcuts, open settings by selecting <em>File->Settings</em> (or do <strong><em>Ctrl-Alt-S</em></strong>) and searching for the <strong>Keymap</strong> tab in Settings.\nPick the file that will work best for you in navigating using keyboard shortcuts.\nThis <a href=\"https://imgur.com/g7eYe1H\">gif will show you how to find and install a keymap like eclipse</a></p>\n<h4>Changing our default terminal app</h4>\n<p>While installing the eclipse keymap is optional, what I would like you to do is to change your terminal of choice to git bash.\nJust like with the gif from below, open up the settings (<strong><em>Ctrl-Alt-S</em></strong>) and search for Terminal.\nNavigate to the <strong><em>Tools</em></strong> on the left sidebar and select the dropdown for the Shell path.\nThere you should see bash.exe with a path for git.\n<strong>Make sure you add the arguments <code class=\"language-text\">-i</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">-l</code> to load your settings correctly</strong>.</p>\n<picture><img

800px\"></picture>\n<h4>Enabling autosave</h4>\n<p>This one I find to be incredibly useful, but it's a double-edged sword, as sometimes tends to break whatever I am working on.\nOn the other hand, it allows me to not have to worry about saving all the time, which is key nowadays.\nHead back to the settings (<strong><em>Ctrl-Alt-S</em></strong>) and type <strong><em>autosave</em></strong>, and then once you are in <strong>System Settings</strong>,\ncheck the option which says to <strong><em>Save files if the IDE is idle for 15 seconds</em></strong>.</p>\n<h4>Link webstorm to nvm</h4>\n<p>This last one is important as it tells Webstorm where our node version is, which helps with IDE integration.\nBack in the Settings window, type <strong><em>Node interpreter</em></strong> in the search box, which should lead you to <em>Languages &#x26; Frameworks->Node.js</em>.\nClick on the Node interpreter dropdown, and select <strong><em>Add...->Add local...</em></strong>.\nClick the home button, then

(including the token generation if you don't save the token somewhere) for each computer that you use.</em></strong></p>\n<h3>9: Make changes</h3>\n<p>By this point, your project should be open.</p>\n<p>What you should do is watch\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/blj5aGh\">this animation a few times to see how to make changes to the markdown file</a>\nand how to send those changes so that they are recorded on GitHub.</p>\n<p>Because we are editing a markdown file, Webstorm defaults for it to be in preview mode,\nbut if I were to have clicked the middle button it would have shown a split preview between the raw text and what it looks like. (instead of flipping back and forth)</p>\n<p>Also, notice the green button at the top - <picture><img src=\"/static/03e660a109682c93c4656eb059c0a304/9d635/git_green_button.png\" alt=\"green commit button\" srcset=\"/static/03e660a109682c93c4656eb059c0a304/9d635/git_green_button.png 96w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 96px) 100vw, 96px\"></picture>.\nThat is used to create a commit, which is a record of the changes that you have made.\n<strong>You'll want to get in the habit of committing often</strong>.\nCommitting small changes is a good idea because then you can more easily keep track of (and potentially revert changes).\nIt's also a good way to document what has been added or changed as well.</p>\n<p>As you are toying around, you may get a popup like this in webstorm.</p>\n<picture><img src=\"/static/527957784785204815e854504a227a21/1f083/add_file_to_git.png\" alt=\"popup asking if you want to add files to git\" srcset=\"/static/527957784785204815e854504a227a21/772e8/add_file_to_git.png 200w,\n/static/527957784785204815e854504a227a21/e17e5/add_file_to_git.png 400w,\n/static/527957784785204815e854504a227a21/1f083/add_file_to_git.png 660w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px\"></picture>\n<p>Like the picture shows, I would check <strong><em>Don't ask again</em></strong> and then click <strong><em>Cancel</em></strong>.\nI like to be purposeful in my commits in git, so I do not like adding in files to be tracked that may not be necessary.</p>\n<h3>10: Understand the process</h3>\n<p>For every project that we have thereafter, there will most likely be a new repo that you'll need to add to Webstorm using some of the steps that we've highlighted here.\nFor every repo you'll need to accept the assignment and open up a new project from VCS.\nYou won't need to generate a new token, however.\nThe process that we follow here is merely to get you to understand the workflow for checking out projects from GitHub.</p>\n<p>Feel free to make as many changes as you'd like to the repo, just make sure you include the information from the exercises below.\nThere you'll also see how you can <a href=\"#07---verifying-changes-made-it-to-github\">verify that your changes appear on GitHub</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tasks\">\n<h3>Exercises 0.7-0.9</h3>\n<p>To submit the assignment you'll be making changes that will appear in your GitHub repo.\nFor one, I would like you to edit the file that we created via Webstorm and add your name to the markdown file.</p>\n<h4>0.7 - Verifying changes made it to GitHub</h4>\n<p>You should have been following along here with the reading.\nOnce you completed the steps above and push, verify that you have finished by visiting <strong>github.com</strong> and clicking on your repository.\nOnce there, you can click to see <a href=\"https://imgur.com/fpaI9XK\">this gif animation that helps you verify that the commits were made on GitHub</a></p>\n<p>Like the image, you should see your changes on github.com and you should see your profile and link as well.</p>\n<p>Like the gif above click on the text that has your commit message and you'll see the\nchanges that you committed and how your commit changed the file, which\nyou can immediately identify.\nIf you see your custom picture and your\nname or id, then you'll get the rest of the credit.\nIf you don't, then\nsimply make an additional change to one of the files (adding a line or a\nspace) while <a href=\"#3-configure-git\">editing the user preferences as outlined earlier</a>.</p>\n<h4>0.8 - Upload exercises from exercises 0.1-0.6</h4>\n<p>Now that GitHub has been setup correctly,\nplease upload the materials from the previous section\n<a href=\"/part0/fundamentals_of_web_apps#exercises-0-1-0-6\">Exercises 0.1-0.6</a> into your GitHub repo.\nMake sure you put them in a folder and provide them with names that match the exercise that you had.</p>\n<h4>0.9 - Final upload screenshot</h4>\n<p>Finally, upload a screenshot of your WebStorm IDE showing the embedded git bash terminal and having typed <code class=\"language-text\">nvm</code> list.<br>\nPlease name the screenshot file with the name <code class=\"language-text\">09</code>.\nMake sure the file has the correct extension.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">\n<h3>Recommended: Learn to use git via the command line</h3>\n<p><strong>It's vital that you feel comfortable using git.</strong></p>\n<p>If you have not worked with Git or GitHub at all and/or still feel uneasy about using it,\nplease follow along with the tutorial below.\nFor further reinforcement, you may also want to see this <a href=\"https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners\">Git and GitHub tutorial for beginners</a>.</p>\n<p>While the workflow in JetBrains is fairly good for what we want,\n(especially if you start leaning into keyboard shortcuts),\nat some point you are going to want to do something that is beyond what's available.\nThe best thing that you can do to help yourself is to begin to practice using git on the command line.\nIt is harder to use.\nHowever, there are many more resources out there (like stackoverflow) that give you a git command to do some neat things,\nlike amend your last commit, or go back a couple of commits, among other things.</p>\n<p>For this, we'll continue getting comfortable with git bash.\nThe first thing that you'll need to do is to ensure that you can navigate to the location of where your project is located.\nIf you’re not sure how to\nuse the command line, feel free to ask in the discord, but the easiest commands to learn\nare:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">cd</code> (changes the directory to the one specified afterward, to go up use\n<code class=\"language-text\">cd ..</code>)</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">ls</code> (list the files in a directory, if you want to see all files, say <code class=\"language-text\">ls –a</code>)</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">mkdir</code> (makes a directory with the name you specify afterward)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And press the tab key to autocomplete any folders and folder paths as\nyou type so that you don’t misspell things as you go along.\nAnother\nother option you have is, if you are on your computer, to use windows\nexplorer to get to the directory where you want to download the project,\nand then right-click and select <em>Git Bash Here</em>.\nIf you are on windows and using the new <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/terminal\">Terminal</a>,\nyou can also click the folder from explorer and drag the folder from windows into Terminal to have it automatically type the path for you.\nOnce you are inside the correct place that you want to be, then you can move on.\nLastly, one of the last ways to do this is merely via Webstorm.\nYou can right-click on your project and say <strong><em>Open In->Terminal</em></strong>, and the terminal will open down below.</p>\n<h3>Learning the git commands in bash</h3>\n<p>While we will use WebStorms's git integration and tools to help us commit regularly,\nknowing a little bit about how to use the command line will be important for this course.\nOne of the most important parts of knowing how to use the command line is being able to navigate through your folders.</p>\n<p>Anytime you make any changes or commands, it's important to understand where you are.\nLet's verify that you are in fact in the correct place.\nWhen using git bash, you know you have entered a git repository when you see that the command line shows <strong><em><code class=\"language-text\">(name_of_branch)</code></em></strong> in a different color.\nIn our case, notice how the end of the prompt ends with\n<code class=\"language-text\">main</code>.\nThat lets you know that you are on the main branch of a git\nproject.  I will move up a directory and down just so you can see the difference.</p>\n<picture><img src=\"/static/023c42d9e265599601ee93d92e4d7e61/5a190/image5.png\" alt=\"git terminal showing main as repo\"

class=\"language-text\">.gitignore</code> and a folder called <code class=\"language-text\">.git</code>.\nYou may not see those files if you type <code class=\"language-text\">ls</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>You do not want to play around or modify the .git folder.</strong></p>\n<p>You also want to be careful not to create repositories with git inside of other repositories that have a git folder.\nSo make sure that any projects that you clone have no nested or cloned projects inside.</p>\n<p>For this part, we were only interested in getting you used to the\nmechanics of adding, committing and pushing changes up to GitHub.\nSo here’s what I’m going to ask you to do.</p>\n<h3><code class=\"language-text\">git status</code> is your friend</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>With the terminal open,\ntype <code class=\"language-text\">git status</code> to see what’s changed.\nIf nothing has changed, you can add a file or make a new file in the directory.</li>\n</ol>\n<picture><img src=\"/static/0ed917ffd3ca19adecd311540e68b75f/5a190/image7.png\" alt=\"git status showing lots of untracked files\"

gives us.\nIt tells us that we have a file (or in this case a folder) that is <strong>untracked</strong>,\nwhich means that git is not monitoring them for any changes.\nWhen untracked files change, <em>git knows nothing about them</em>.\nSo let's add a set of files so that git starts tracking them for any changes.\nLet's practice adding one set of files to what will be our next commit.\nPart of what you need to do is add a picture or screenshot to the repo, which can you can drag into WebStorm on top of your <em>lab0</em> folder.\nYou'll see a <em>move</em> window pop up that you can click <strong><em>Refactor</em></strong>.\nGo ahead and do that.\nType <code class=\"language-text\">git status</code> again and you'll now see the file appear as an untracked file.</p>\n<picture><img

783px\"></picture>\n<p>To get git to start tracking a file, you can say:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">git</span> <span class=\"token function\">add</span> path/to/name_of_file.extension</code></pre></div>\n<p><strong><em>Don't forget about Tab completion!</em></strong>\nI seldom type anything out anymore.\nAfter I type a few letters, I press <strong><em>Tab</em></strong> to have the shell give its best suggestion and make sure I have the right location and no typos.\nYou can even press Tab again if you get no further completions to see the list of everything available for files.</p>\n<p>If you type <code class=\"language-text\">git status</code> again, you'll notice that now you have a file that is staged, while the other files and folders would still be unstaged.\nIn the example above, if instead had added the .idea folder (and not the png), it would look like this:</p>\n<picture><img src=\"/static/cc2e793189a9018fcf8f63ff8f7ea5e4/cda19/usersettingsadded.png\" alt=\"git status showing staged and unstaged files\"

changes</strong>.\nWhat this means is that not only is git going to track them, but they are different than what is currently in the repo,\nand so if you <strong>commit</strong>, you would be placing those changes and additions formally into the git record/history.\nIf you'd like, please add the remaining file, which you can do by writing</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">git</span> <span class=\"token function\">add</span> <span class=\"token builtin class-name\">.</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Once you do a <code class=\"language-text\">git status</code> again, you'll now see that all of the files are staged to be committed (lots of green files), while nothing is red anymore.\nThis means that the next time you say commit via git all of the files will be placed into and tracked by the repository.</p>\n<h3>Committing via the command line</h3>\n<p>In this case, let's write this line</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">git</span> commit -m <span class=\"token string\">\"Adding screenshot and other repo files from webstorm\"</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>By having the <code class=\"language-text\">-m</code>, we are providing the commit message that we would like to have to help us know what we did in this particular commit.</p>\n<p>Let's make one more change to the file so that we can dive a little bit deeper into staged vs unstaged.\nGo ahead and open up your README.md and move over to Line 3 or so, where you have the description.\nModify the description one more time, or add another comment to the file.\nSave the file and then back at the command prompt, do a <code class=\"language-text\">git status</code> again.\nOnce you do, you'll see something like this (except yours will be for readme):</p>\n<picture><img src=\"/static/9d5c266a039d09825115d46e89c37353/5a190/gitmodifiednotstaged.png\" alt=\"git status showing modified files that haven&#x27;t been

800px\"></picture>\n<p>Notice that the red text does not say it is untracked,\nbut rather that it has been modified.\nFurthermore, if we were to commit right now, nothing would happen.\nIn git when you save a file, git merely tells you that the file that you have saved differs from what you had before.\nIf you want that file to become part of the record, you'll need to stage the changes, which you can do again by calling this ambiguous term <code class=\"language-text\">add</code>.\nIf you were to add the file, then it would show in green again to let you know that it will be committed.\nHowever, there is a way to automatically commit any of your tracked files into your repository, which is to use the flag -a, so typically when I commit, I do something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">git</span> commit -am <span class=\"token string\">\"Personalized the readme with my name Osvaldo\"</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>While\nI typically use the <code class=\"language-text\">-a</code> flag to automatically add all my changes to the next commit, one reason for not\nautomatically adding (or staging) all changes is to make multiple commits so that you split\napart multiple changes that you’ve made.\nLeaving files unstaged won’t\nmake them a part of the commit, so you can commit multiple times and add\nthe appropriate files to address each bug or feature for example and to provide an appropriate message for each.\nTherefore, if you made multiple changes, each commit will have just the files related to that change or improvement instead of a bunch of unrelated things.</p>\n<p>However, because I advocate for committing often, I will mostly have you use the -a option so that git commits all changes to tracked files.</p>\n<p>Committing will save the changes to the local repository.\nThe <code class=\"language-text\">–a</code> switch\nwill commit all modified files, both staged and unstaged, while the <code class=\"language-text\">–m</code>\nallows you to type your message as part of the commit, instead of\nopening up that text editor option that we had before.\nIf you have new\nfiles that git has yet to keep track of, then you must say:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">git</span> <span class=\"token function\">add</span> NAME_OF_FILE_OR_DIR</code></pre></div>\n<p>Again, <strong>you only need to do this last part when you have new files</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Pushing the changes via the command line</h3>\n<p>Once you have committed, go ahead and push the files to the server.\nType\n<code class=\"language-text\">git push origin main</code> and read the messages that are given to make sure that the\npush was indeed successful.</p>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"mainImage":{"publicURL":"/static/b9999ec785b2c3bc6b8d3ef5d3537538/part-0.svg"},"part":0,"letter":"d","lang":"en"}}},"pageContext":{"part":0,"letter":"d","lang":"en"}}}
