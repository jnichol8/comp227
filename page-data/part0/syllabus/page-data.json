Check #announcements, #help or #sos to see if your concern has been addressed already.\nIf not, post your question to this discussion.</li>\n<li>We may use Canvas tools such as WebEx for Q&#x26;A sessions and please follow the instruction the instructor sends out through Canvas Announcement.</li>\n<li>Read directions carefully.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For posts to online discussions, conventions of online etiquette (\"netiquette\") which include courtesy to all users, will be observed.\nPlease see Guidelines for Online Discussion for detail.</p>\n<h3>Discord &#x26; Course Netiquette</h3>\n<p>You can discuss the course and related topics in our <a href=\"https://discord.gg/VRUKRxCJ95\">Discord</a>.\nDiscord will have different channels for both your learning partners as well as course-related conversations.\nYou will be expected to be active on Discord!</p>\n<p>For those of you who are new to online learning and online discussion, there are some important differences between how you communicate online and in the classroom.\nThese differences are frequently the cause of misunderstandings in courses that have an online component.\nThe following guidelines are intended to help you understand the differences and communicate in a way that minimizes the chances of misunderstandings.</p>\n<h4>Remember you cannot see each other</h4>\n<p>The most important difference between face-to-face communication and using an online discussion is that you cannot see each other.\nFor the most part, humans rely on visual and audio cues when talking to each other.\nWhen we speak face to face we can interpret what the other person is saying through their posture, tone of voice, and expression.\nAll of this is missing when communicating through discussion forums.\nYou can’t easily tell what the intent is when reading a response to a message in a discussion board.\nThere are no visual cues.\nThere is no tone of voice to convey emotion.\nThere is only text.\nIt is easy to make assumptions about a person’s intent when you are lacking the cues that you would take for granted otherwise.\nBelow are some guidelines for communication in online courses that will help you make the most out of your online interactions.</p>\n<h4>Keep a positive tone</h4>\n<p>Everyone in your class is there to learn, just as you are.\nDiscussions are a great way to understand different perspectives.\nIf a conversation remains positive, then it is a lot more likely that everyone will get something useful out of it.\nAvoid any language that can be construed as angry, sarcastic, or even humorous.</p>\n<h4>Don’t take things personally</h4>\n<p>As mentioned above, there is no way for you to know for sure what that person writing intends.\nGiven that the discussions are supposed to be a community building experience, assume that the responses are meant to be helpful.\nIf you have questions about a post, contact your instructor.</p>\n<h4>When in doubt, take a break before posting</h4>\n<p>If you do find yourself becoming emotionally involved in the discussion, take a break for a half hour.\nThen revisit what you were about to post with an eye to how others would interpret it.\nOnce you post a message there is no deleting or taking it back.</p>\n<h4>Be patient, few are online 24/7</h4>\n<p>Remember that all the people in your course have lives outside of the class they are taking.\nIf you ask a question or need clarification, it may be a day or two before you get a response.\nAs for me, I vow that I'll respond to you as quickly as I can, but I am not always available immediately.</p>\n<h4>Help others</h4>\n<p>You are all in this together.\nIf someone in the course has a problem with the system or needs help in another way, feel free.\nMany of you will have more experience and your assistance will be appreciated.</p>\n<h3>Attendance policies</h3>\n<p>Even though this is an asynchronous online course, attendance will be counted by how responsive you are on discord.\nYou will be expected to respond to any discussion via discord in a reasonable timeframe (24-48 hours).\nAfter having to contact you via other methods or bringing responsiveness in discord to your attention,\nany subsequent attempts to contact you will lower part of your social learning exercises grade by two percentage points.\nIn addition to me reaching out, you will be expected to be in contact with others during the course and will be placed into learning pairs or triads.\nYou will be expected to communicate in those discord channels with your learning groups on a regular basis as well\nand will be expected to meet with them on a regular basis to go over the material.\nThis means that you'll be expected to meet online with those groups either over Discord or via Zoom (or in person if you prefer).\n<strong>Chatting privately via DMs will not count towards your expectations of regular communication.</strong>\nThose meetings are crucial to your learning and your peers, and so you will be expected to make them up if you cannot make it, or forfeit your ability to pass the course.</p>\n<h3>Pronouns</h3>\n<p>Knowing and applying the names and pronouns that students use is a crucial part of developing a productive learning environment\nthat fosters safety, inclusion, personal dignity, and a sense of belonging across campus.\nPlease let me know your preferred name and pronoun anytime throughout the semester.</p>\n<h3>Grading Scale</h3>\n<p>The following minimum percentages are required to achieve the corresponding grades:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>A</th>\n<th>A-</th>\n<th>B+</th>\n<th>B</th>\n<th>B-</th>\n<th>C+</th>\n<th>C</th>\n<th>C-</th>\n<th>D</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>93</td>\n<td>90</td>\n<td>87</td>\n<td>83</td>\n<td>80</td>\n<td>77</td>\n<td>73</td>\n<td>70</td>\n<td>63</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The grading will come from these areas, however, the percentages are tentative and subject to change.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Individual Exercises</td>\n<td>45%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Social Learning Exercises &#x26; Attendance</td>\n<td>20%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Final Project</td>\n<td>25%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Other Activities</td>\n<td>10%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Major Assignments and Examinations</h3>\n<p>The course is composed of a few parts</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Individual Exercises</li>\n<li>Social Learning Exercises</li>\n<li>Final Project</li>\n<li>Other Activities</li>\n<li>Course Exam</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Individual Exercises</h4>\n<p>Part of your grade for the course will be based on the total number of submitted exercises for the required parts (including exercises marked with an asterisk).</p>\n<p><strong>Your grade will not completely come from these exercises</strong>.</p>\n<p>We will be having other exercises and assignments as well that will be just as important to your grade.</p>\n<p>Assume that if there are 138 exercises <strong>(there are not 138 exercises; that count is not final)</strong>, a rough calculation for this portion is as follows:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>exercises</th>\n<th align=\"center\">approx grade for exercises</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>138</td>\n<td align=\"center\">A?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>127</td>\n<td align=\"center\">B+?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>116</td>\n<td align=\"center\">B?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>105</td>\n<td align=\"center\">C?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>94</td>\n<td align=\"center\">C-?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>83</td>\n<td align=\"center\">D?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>72</td>\n<td align=\"center\">F?</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Why did I put it this way? Because this is a guideline, not a contract.\nI don't even know if there are 138 exercises to begin with!\nNevertheless, I wanted to provide this approximation to you so that you have a better understanding of what the expectations look like.\nIf you wish to pass the course, you will need to submit the assignments as listed in Canvas.</p>\n<p>For the other modules, we will determine at a later date which ones will be completed, but these may be done in a different order sequence.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Additional Modules</th>\n<th>Module name</th>\n<th>Minimum Exercises to submit</th>\n<th>work needed</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>Redux</td>\n<td>24</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>React router, hooks &#x26; styling</td>\n<td>24</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>TypeScript</td>\n<td>24</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>React Native</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>With all submissions requested, please follow submission guidelines carefully.</p>\n<p>Students are responsible for reading course material and following instructions posts on Canvas.\nStudents are also responsible for being aware of any announcements the instructor makes through Canvas.</p>\n<h4>Course Exam</h4>\n<p>You must also complete the course exam.\nNotice though that the exam is not listed in your grade breakdown.\nThe exam does not count towards your final grade, but you must pass it to pass the course.\nMore info about the exam will be discussed via canvas and discord in the middle of the semester.</p>\n<p>You can only take the exam after submitting a sufficient number of exercises.\nIt is not wise in practice to take the exam immediately after submitting the critical number of exercises.\nThe exam is the same and does not count toward your grade (you just need to pass it).</p>\n<p>If you complete the assignments and you work through the material in earnest, you will be fine on the exam.</p>\n<h4>Late Assignments and Make-up Work</h4>\n<p>The only acceptable excuses for missing an assignment due date are serious illness, death in the immediate family or important professional activities.\nIllness or death in the family may require documentation.\nExcuses for professional activities must be approved by the instructor in advance.\nLate assignments that are not the individual exercises will be deducted 15% per day and will not be accepted beyond 1 week late.</p>\n<h4>Individual Work and Collaboration</h4>\n<p>Computer professionals usually work in a cooperative environment, yet proper assessment requires that work be done by individuals.\nTo alleviate confusion, the following policy will be followed:</p>\n<p>Collaborative work is encouraged.\nThis includes students working together on problem sets, planning solution strategies, and helping each other to debug programs.\nCollaboration must stop short of the writing of program code or English that represents your work.\nYou may not directly copy the work of another student.\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that the work you submit is an honest representation of your own understanding of the material.</p>\n<p>Marginal cases will be resolved by oral examination of the students involved.\nIf they understand the material in the assignment, it will be considered honest collaboration.\nIf they do not, then it will be considered academic dishonesty.</p>\n<h3>Collection of Work for Assessment</h3>\n<p>Student work may be retained to assess how course learning objectives are being met and for accreditation purposes.\nCopies of student work may be retained to assess how the learning objectives of the course are being met.</p>\n<h3>Honor Code</h3>\n<p>The Honor Code at the University of the Pacific calls upon each student to exhibit a high degree of maturity, responsibility, and personal integrity.\nStudents are expected to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>act honestly in all matters</li>\n<li>actively encourage academic integrity</li>\n<li>discourage any form of cheating or dishonesty by others</li>\n<li>inform the instructor and appropriate university administrator\nif they have a reasonable and good faith belief and substantial evidence that a violation of the Academic Honesty Policy has occurred.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Violations will be referred to and investigated by the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards.\nIf a student is found responsible, it will be documented as part of her or his permanent academic record.\nA student may receive a range of penalties, including failure of an assignment, failure of the course, suspension, or dismissal from the University.\nThe Academic Honesty Policy is located in Tiger Lore and online at <a href=\"http://www.pacific.edu/Campus-Life/Safety-and-Conduct/Student-Conduct/Tiger-LoreStudent-Handbook-.html\">http://www.pacific.edu/Campus-Life/Safety-and-Conduct/Student-Conduct/Tiger-LoreStudent-Handbook-.html</a></p>\n<p>You will be expected to conduct yourself according to professional ethics, just as if this were a real-world job.\nYou should be able to explain any of the code you write and you also need to cite anything longer than a line of code that you get from the internet.\nProvide links to any code and tutorials that you find that help you program.<br>\nMake sure to cite and credit code, libraries, videos, ideas, or other resources that are not provided directly from this website.\nHonor code cases will be resolved by an oral examination of the understanding of the material.\njust as a professional would need to credit the source or fully understand code when receiving help from others.\nStudents are expected to participate as a team, with fair credit given according to effort and participation.</p>\n<h3>Accommodations for Students with Disabilities</h3>\n<p>If you are a student with a disability who requires accommodations,\nplease contact the Director of the Office of Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) for information on how to obtain an Accommodations Request Letter.</p>\n<h4>3-Step Accommodation Process</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Student meets with the SSD Director and provides documentation and completes registration forms.</li>\n<li>Student requests accommodation(s) each semester by completing the Request for Accommodations Form.</li>\n<li>Student arranges to meet with his/her professors to discuss the accommodation(s) and to sign the Accommodation Request Letter\nTo ensure timeliness of services, it is preferable that you obtain the accommodation letter(s) from the Office of SSD as early as possible in each term.\nAfter the instructor receives the accommodation letter, please schedule a meeting with the instructor during office hours or some other mutually convenient time to arrange the accommodation(s).\nThe Office of Services for Students with Disabilities is located in the McCaffrey Center, Rm. 137.\nPhone: 209-946-3221.\nEmail: ssd@pacific.edu.\nOnline: <a href=\"http://www.pacific.edu/disabilities\">http://www.pacific.edu/disabilities</a>\nNOTE: The preceding information is the minimal information
